Modeling a Monarchy
///////////////////
Create an API that descrive a monarchy, and provide a method to report the current order of succession at any time.
A code level API is fine. The API will need methods to describe the following actions:
- Birth
- Death
- Abdication

Rules:
. Oldest child to the current monarch is first
. All of the oldest child's children are next (and down the tree)
. Monarchs siblings are after all of Monarch's descendents
. When someone dies, their children are still higher than the deceased's siblings
. When someone abdicatest, their children are no longer eligible for the crown

Not included:
. Marriage (does not change the succession)
